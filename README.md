# PathoSense - Multiple Diseases Detection

## Overview

PathoSense is an innovative AI-powered application that revolutionizes proactive healthcare by accurately detecting multiple diseases. The application is built using various machine learning algorithms, including Deep Learning, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These algorithms work in tandem to detect a range of diseases, including heart disease, Parkinson's disease, breast cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and pneumonia. The application is developed with Flask, providing a seamless user interaction experience.

PathoSense is designed to provide a valuable second opinion on patient data, enhancing diagnostic accuracy for labs and medical professionals. By leveraging AI and machine learning, it assists in the early detection and diagnosis of diseases, ultimately leading to more effective and timely healthcare interventions.
